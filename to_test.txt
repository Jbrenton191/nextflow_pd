1. Check if leafcutter works with libv8
2. Check if need to add stringi through conda
3. Add rseqc to pipeline and see if that breaks anything
4. Add to config file so don't have to use wrapper
5. Have an outdir in the config file so this can be adjusted each time - ie can run multiple things in the same folder without getting confused
6. Change ensembl side of pipeline so works
7. Test genebody coverage with bigwigs instead of bams to see any change in speed
